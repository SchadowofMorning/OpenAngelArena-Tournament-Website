# OpenAngelArena Tournament Website
## a MEAN Stack website for the OAA Tournament

Not everything works, I want some feedback first

if you want it to work you need
- MongoDB
- rubysass for gulpfile.js
- NodeJS
- Either set API_KEY, MONGOURL and HOSTURL as env-vars or use heroku local and create a .env with this values

### Things that work:
- Creating Account with SteamLogin
- inviting Players per link
- Seeing all available Teams
- Kicking Players from Team

### Things that need implementation:
- Admin Screen
